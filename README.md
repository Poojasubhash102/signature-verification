#Features
#Preprocesses images by converting them to grayscale, resizing, and binarizing.
#Compares the similarity of two signatures using the Normalized Cross-Correlation method (cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED).
#Provides a similarity score and determines if the signatures match based on a predefined threshold.
#Requirements
#Python 3.7 or higher
#OpenCV library for Python
#Install Dependencies
#Use the following command to install required dependencies:
#pip install opencv-python


#Signature Verification
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a signature verification system using OpenCV. 
The system preprocesses two images (a reference signature and an input signature) and compares their similarity using template matching.
