#Features
Preprocesses images by converting them to grayscale, resizing, and binarizing.
Compares the similarity of two signatures using the Normalized Cross-Correlation method (cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED).
Provides a similarity score and determines if the signatures match based on a predefined threshold.

Signature Verification
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a signature verification system using OpenCV. 
The system preprocesses two images (a reference signature and an input signature) and compares their similarity using template matching.

Features
Preprocesses images by converting them to grayscale, resizing, and binarizing.
Compares the similarity of two signatures using the Normalized Cross-Correlation method (cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED).
Provides a similarity score and determines if the signatures match based on a predefined threshold.
Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV library for Python
Install Dependencies
Use the following command to install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python

├── app.py                # Main script for the project
├── img1.jpeg             # Reference signature (example image)
├── img2.jpeg             # Input signature (example image)
└── README.md             # Documentation
#Usage
Prepare Signature Images:
Place the reference signature (img1.jpeg) and input signature (img2.jpeg) in the project directory.
Run the Script: 
Execute the script using the following command:
python app.py
#Output:
If the signatures match, you’ll see a message like:
Signatures match (Similarity Score: 0.85)
If they don’t match:
Signatures do not match (Similarity Score: 0.72)
Configuration
#Threshold
The default threshold for a match is set to 0.8. 
You can modify this value in the script:
threshold = 0.8
#Future Enhancements
Implement region-based comparison for more accurate results.
Add GUI for easier interaction.
Support for additional image preprocessing techniques.
